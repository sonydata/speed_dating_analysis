# 💘 Speed Dating Analysis

This project analyzes real-world speed dating data to uncover what drives interest and attraction. The dataset was collected from experimental speed dating events at Columbia University and includes self-perceptions, evaluations of others, dating decisions, and post-event follow-up behavior.

## 🧠 Key Findings Summary

- **Attraction, fun, and shared interests** were the strongest predictors of mutual matches.
- **Interest similarity** mattered more than **same race**.
- **Self-perceived attractiveness** increased likelihood of being contacted.
- **Earlier and final interactions** led to higher match and “yes” rates.
- **Radar charts** revealed **mismatches** between what genders believe the other wants vs. what they actually want.
- **Decision tree** showed that second-date behavior is influenced by follow-up contact, fun, ambition, shared hobbies, and dating activity levels.
